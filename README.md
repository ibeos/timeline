# Timeline

This [website](https://ibeos.github.io/timeline) uses [vis-timeline](https://github.com/visjs/vis-timeline) to display historical dates.

These dates are organized in multiple timelines, which can also have subcategories. Up to three timelines can be displayed at once.  
To add or remove timelines, use the options button in the bottom-right corner.

The sidebar can be opened in the top-right corner and can be toggled to show
* The entire dataset of items in all currently displayed timelines
* A custom selection of items

Items get added to the selection by clicking on them in the timeline.

## Controls:

* Scrolling the mouse moves the timeline view left or right
* Holding control while scrolling zooms in or out
